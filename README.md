# Generative AI Workshop: Using GPT APIs and ChatGPT for Quality Assurance

Welcome to the "Generative AI Workshop: Using GPT APIs and ChatGPT for Quality Assurance!" In this hands-on session, you will learn how to practically use Generative AI to enhance Quality Assurance processes. We will explore the basics of Generative AI, demonstrate its usage through APIs and a chatbot interface, and work together to solve a real-world problem using these cutting-edge technologies.

## Prerequisites

Before attending this workshop, please ensure you have the following:

1.  Python Programming Knowledge: Basic understanding of Python programming language as we will use Python for code examples and exercises.


2.  OpenAI API Access: You will need an OpenAI account to access the GPT API. If you don't have an account, you can create one on the OpenAI website.


3.  OpenAI API Key: After creating your OpenAI account https://platform.openai.com/, you will need an API key to interact with the GPT API. Once you create your account, setup your secret API key following the instructions here https://www.onmsft.com/how-to/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/ 


4.  Git Repository: To follow along with the workshop exercises, please clone the following Git repository: <https://github.com/twCatalyst/genAIVodqa2023>. You can clone the repository using the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/twCatalyst/genAIVodqa2023.git`


5. PyCharm CE: Please have PyCharm Community Edition (CE) installed on your computer, as we will be using it as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for our coding activities. Download the IDE from here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download
