# Generative AI Workshop: Using GPT APIs and ChatGPT for Quality Assurance

Welcome to the "Generative AI Workshop: Using GPT APIs and ChatGPT for Quality Assurance!" In this hands-on session, you will learn how to practically use Generative AI to enhance Quality Assurance processes. We will explore the basics of Generative AI, demonstrate its usage through APIs and a chatbot interface, and work together to solve a real-world problem using these cutting-edge technologies.

## Prerequisites

Before attending this workshop, please ensure you have the following:

1.  Python Programming Knowledge: Basic understanding of Python programming language as we will use Python for code examples and exercises.


2.  OpenAI API Access: You will need an OpenAI account to access the GPT API. If you don't have an account, you can create one on the OpenAI website.


3.  OpenAI API Key: After creating your OpenAI account https://platform.openai.com/, you will need an API key to interact with the GPT API. Once you create your account, setup your secret API key following the instructions here https://www.onmsft.com/how-to/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/ 


4.  Git Repository: To follow along with the workshop exercises, please clone the following Git repository: <https://github.com/twCatalyst/genAIVodqa2023>. You can clone the repository using the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/twCatalyst/genAIVodqa2023.git`


5. PyCharm CE: Please have PyCharm Community Edition (CE) installed on your computer, as we will be using it as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for our coding activities. Download the IDE from here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download
Follow the following instructions to setup the IDE to import the above project into your IDE

# Workshop setup

1. Create an OpenAI account for free credits (Use a personal email address for the free credits)
https://www.saintlad.com/get-free-trial-credits-for-openai/

2. Ensure you have a Secret API key for OpenAI
https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/
Download the Git repository for the workshop
```$> git clone https://github.com/twCatalyst/genAIVodqa2023```
OR,
Download the Zip file from the following URL - https://github.com/twCatalyst/genAIVodqa2023 and unzip the folder into your choice of folder on your machine

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine:

Windows:
https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html

Mac:
https://www.scaler.com/topics/python/how-to-install-python-on-macos/

Set up a Python virtual environment on your machine and follow along with the course
Go to the folder genAIVodqa2023 and try one of the following commands on your terminal/DOS Window/IDE Terminal

```$> python -m venv venv ```
OR,

```$> python3 -m venv venv```

You should see a venv folder in the genAIVodqa2023 folder if you are successful

Once you create the venv folder, activate your virtual environment by running the following command

On Macs 
```$> source ./venv/bin/activate ```

On Windows run
```$> venv/Scripts/activate.bat```
 
Install the requirements (Make sure you are in the genAIVodqa2023 folder)
		
```$> pip install -r requirements.txt```
		OR, 
```$> pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Set up your OpenAI secret key as an environment variable
On Macs
```export OPENAI_KEY=<your_secret_key>```
On Windows
```set OPENAI_KEY=<your_secret_key>```

Once you have installed your requirements, run the following command from the terminal/DOS Window/IDE Terminal

```$> python session2-simple-calls/simple-call.py```

If you used pip3 above after setting up the virtual environment, run the following:

```$> python3 session2-simple-calls/simple-call.py```
